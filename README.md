# RER A GATE
## Tower-Defense
The RER A is a Parisian public transport network that we all love, of course, and which is renowned for its punctuality and reliability (again, of course). To celebrate it, we've decided to create a defense tower in its honor. Build your own stations and defend them against the evil ticket inspectors and sneaky grannies who want to expose you to them!
Don't let them take over our beloved line!

## Basic game mechanics
Tower Defense is a single-player game that takes place on a given map, with one or more paths leading to a base that the player must protect or lose the game. Waves of enemies appear at regular intervals at the entrance to the map, heading towards the base at varying speeds with the aim of destroying it.

To protect the base, players must buy towers with the money at their disposal (1,000 at the start of the game), which they can place on the map. These towers, whose type determines their power, rate and price, automatically fire at enemies within range. Killing enemies earns the player money, which can be used to buy more towers.
Waves of enemies get tougher and tougher (in terms of life and speed), and the player's aim is to keep his base alive as long as possible. The player's final score is determined by the number of waves survived.

## How to play
The player can launch the game with the space bar, pause it with the P key and exit with escape.
